The Newborn Screening Program screens for all of the core conditions except Spinal Muscular Atrophy, which began in June 2020.

In 2012, the survey methodology of the California BRFSS changed significantly so that the survey would be more representative of the general population. Several changes were implemented: 1) the survey became dual-frame, with both cell and landline random-digit dial components, 2) residents of college housing were eligible to complete the BRFSS, and 3) raking or iterative proportional fitting was used to calculate the survey weights.

Hospitalizations due to these medical conditions are potentially preventable through access to high-quality outpatient care.  The conditions include: diabetes short-term complications; diabetes long-term complications; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma in older adults (age 40 and over); hypertension; heart failure; community-acquired pneumonia; urinary tract infection; uncontrolled diabetes; asthma in younger adults (age 18-39); and lower-extremity amputation among patients with diabetes.  The composite measures include overall, acute conditions, chronic conditions, and diabetes (new, 2016).  The data provides a good starting point for assessing quality of health services in the community.  The data does not measure hospital quality.  Note: In 2015, HCAI (formerly OSHPD) only released the first three quarters of data due to a change in the reporting of diagnoses from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM codes, effective October 1, 2015.  Due to the significant differences resulting from the code change, the ICD-9-CM data is distinguished from the ICD-10-CM data in the data file beginning in 2016.\",\n\"https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/f2b33545-db0a-4a53-a611-41de532e7c53/resource/7c7aed93-3643-43b8-92fc-324bf8fc13f2/download/ca-hcai-preventablehospitalizations-county_2005-2023.csv\"]],\n        columns: [[\"number\", \"index\"], [\"string\", \"Title\"], [\"string\", \"Description\"], [\"string\", \"Download Link\"]],\n        columnOptions: [{\"width\": \"1px\", \"className\": \"index_column\"}],\n        rowsPerPage: 25,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n\n      function appendQuickchartButton(parentElement) {\n        let quickchartButtonContainerElement = document.createElement('div');\n        quickchartButtonContainerElement.innerHTML = `\n    <div id=\"df-4697e504-5ec1-41ce-b71b-7c1f3b9395aa\">\n      <button class=\"colab-df-quickchart\" onclick=\"quickchart('df-4697e504-5ec1-41ce-b71b-7c1f3b9395aa')\"\n                title=\"Suggest charts\"\n                style=\"display:none;\">\n\n<svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n     width=\"24px\">\n    <g>\n        <path d=\"M19 3H5c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2zM9 17H7v-7h2v7zm4 0h-2V7h2v10zm4 0h-2v-4h2v4z\"/>\n    </g>\n</svg>\n      </button>\n\n<style>\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n      --bg-color: #E8F0FE;\n      --fill-color: #1967D2;\n      --hover-bg-color: #E2EBFA;\n      --hover-fill-color: #174EA6;\n      --disabled-fill-color: #AAA;\n      --disabled-bg-color: #DDD;\n  }\n\n  [theme=dark] .colab-df-quickchart {\n      --bg-color: #3B4455;\n      --fill-color: #D2E3FC;\n      --hover-bg-color: #434B5C;\n      --hover-fill-color: #FFFFFF;\n      --disabled-bg-color: #3B4455;\n      --disabled-fill-color: #666;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart {\n    background-color: var(--bg-color);\n    border: none;\n    border-radius: 50%;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    display: none;\n    fill: var(--fill-color);\n    height: 32px;\n    padding: 0;\n    width: 32px;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart:hover {\n    background-color: var(--hover-bg-color);\n    box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n    fill: var(--button-hover-fill-color);\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-quickchart-complete:disabled,\n  .colab-df-quickchart-complete:disabled:hover {\n    background-color: var(--disabled-bg-color);\n    fill: var(--disabled-fill-color);\n    box-shadow: none;\n  }\n\n  .colab-df-spinner {\n    border: 2px solid var(--fill-color);\n    border-color: transparent;\n    border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    animation:\n      spin 1s steps(1) infinite;\n  }\n\n  @keyframes spin {\n    0% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    20% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    30% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-left-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    40% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-top-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    60% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    80% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-right-color: var(--fill-color);\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n    90% {\n      border-color: transparent;\n      border-bottom-color: var(--fill-color);\n    }\n  }\n</style>\n\n      <script>\n        async function quickchart(key) {\n          const quickchartButtonEl =\n            document.querySelector('#' + key + ' button');\n          quickchartButtonEl.disabled = true;  // To prevent multiple clicks.\n          quickchartButtonEl.classList.add('colab-df-spinner');\n          try {\n            const charts = await google.colab.kernel.invokeFunction(\n                'suggestCharts', [key], {});\n          } catch (error) {\n            console.error('Error during call to suggestCharts:', error);\n          }\n          quickchartButtonEl.classList.remove('colab-df-spinner');\n          quickchartButtonEl.classList.add('colab-df-quickchart-complete');\n        }\n        (() => {\n          let quickchartButtonEl =\n            document.querySelector('#df-4697e504-5ec1-41ce-b71b-7c1f3b9395aa button');\n          quickchartButtonEl.style.display =\n            google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
